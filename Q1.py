# 1.Counter class declared that contains 4 functions:
# constructor: This function will initialize the value of the counter.
# increase_one: This function will increase the value of the counter by one.
# decrease_one: This function will decrease the value of the counter by one.
# get_value: This function will return the value of the counter.
# All functions are empty and your job is to fill them with the proper code needed to make it work as expected.
#
# Fill the content of the class Counter to make it behave as expected.
#
# Initialize a variable self.counter and use it in every function.
# If your class behaves as expected, the output in the console should be:
# 1
# 3
# 1
